### 12/28/2023
- Do I have the data required to group by type or by industry? 
    - No, not with the current dataset

### 12/30/2023
Current emphasis (given available data):
1. Which counties in Colorado have the highest number of business filings?
    (assuming principal/mailing addresses can be used to determine the county)
2. Is there an increasing trend in the number of business filings in Colorado over the past 5 years?
(`entityformdate`)
3. What has been the trend in business filings over the past 10 years? (`entityformdate`)
4. How have business filings varied month-over-month in the last 12 months? (`entityformdate`)
5. Is there foreign investment in Colorado? If so, which countries are investing and where?

Additional Data Needed:
- **At the state level, which types of businesses or industries are most prevalent?**
  - *(Not Answerable with Current Data: donâ€™t have direct industry classification data.)*
- **On a county basis, which types of businesses or industries are most common?**
  - *(Not Answerable with Current Data: Similar to the state-level question, lack industry classification.)*
- **In different regions, what are the most common types of businesses or industries?**
  - *(Not Answerable with Current Data: Requires industry data which is not present.)*
- **What business types are most prevalent? Was this always the case?**
